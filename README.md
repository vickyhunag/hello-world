# hello-world
This my first project to learn git.

My name is Vicky Huang. I am a beautiful girl.
My career is coding engineer. 
I'm glad to be here to learn a new tool about version control.
I've used SVN subversion before in my job.

Now I'm dedicated to financial field.
Help people to gain their wealth and time.
Take back their life. Achieve their dreams.
